                        A Woman Owned and Gay founded Company. 
                        The Scarlet Sage Herb Co. was founded by two revolutionary 
                        herbalist womyn, Dino and Lisa. Dino and Lisa are western 
                        herbalists and homeopaths who created a sanctuary of healing 
                        in the city where little has been able to match its weight in 
                        witchiness, variety, and herbal medicine knowledge. In July 2015 
                        Laura Ash, a former employee, acquired Scarlet Sage 
                        (passed the broom, if you will) in order for Dino and Lisa 
                        to retire.
